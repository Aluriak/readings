# Readings
Search and aggregate things to read, directly from [Writing Prompts subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts).

To end-user, Writing Prompts subreddit's submissions are *topics*, and top-level comments are *stories*.

This python code allow to automatically retrieves stories from reddit, and print them in the terminal or in the web browser.
Further developpments should allow end users to send content to [pocket](https://getpocket.com/).


## Installation
In a python 3 [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/):

    pip install requirements.txt

or

    pip3 install requirements.txt

depending of your environment.



## Usage
Currently, there is only CLI (terminal) and API (programming), as described in the following.

### CLI

    python -m readings term --min-score=500
